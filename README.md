# Python Spatial ML Exploration (or Spatial-ML)

A collection of Python notebooks and scripts demonstrating various spatial machine learning techniques for analysis, clustering, prediction, and optimization using primarily synthetic and some example open datasets.

## 🎯 Goals
* To provide clear, runnable examples of common spatial ML tasks.
* To explore the application of ML algorithms to geospatial data.
* To showcase visualization techniques for spatial data and model results.
