    "## 12: Hierarchical 2SFCA for Equitable Access to Care\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To model healthcare accessibility by accounting for both resource competition (supply vs. demand) and the need to match patients with an appropriate level of care. This moves beyond simple travel time to a more nuanced measure of service equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "We will implement the **Hierarchical Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (H-2SFCA)** method.\n",
    "1.  **Define Service Tiers:** Assign capabilities to our facility hierarchy (GP, Community, Acute).\n",
    "2.  **Step 1 (Supply-Side):** For each facility, calculate its provider-to-population ratio within its service area.\n",
    "3.  **Step 2 (Demand-Side):** For each residential area (LSOA), sum the ratios of all *appropriate* facilities it can reach.\n",
    "4.  **Visualize Tiered Access:** Create separate maps for Primary, Community, and Acute care accessibility to identify different types of healthcare deserts."

    "### 5. Analysis and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2SFCA method provides a much richer understanding of accessibility than travel time alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reveals Hidden Disparities:** An area might appear to have good access because it's close to a facility (low travel time), but if that facility is overwhelmed with demand from a large population, the actual accessibility is low. The 2SFCA score captures this.\n",
    "- **Highlights Different 'Deserts':** The maps clearly show that an area can be a 'desert' for one type of care but not another. For example, a suburban area might have excellent access to GP practices (Map A) but very poor access to specialized acute care (Map C).\n",
    "- **Informs Systemic Planning:** This analysis is vital for health service planners. It helps identify not just where to put new facilities, but *what kind* of facilities are needed most in specific areas to ensure equitable access across all tiers of care."
