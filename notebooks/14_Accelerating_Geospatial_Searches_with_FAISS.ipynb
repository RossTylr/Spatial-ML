    "## 14: Accelerating Geospatial Searches with FAISS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To demonstrate the utility of Facebook AI's Similarity Search (`faiss`) library for dramatically accelerating nearest-neighbor searches in a geospatial context. For large-scale problems, this is a critical optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "1.  **Create a Large-Scale Scenario:** Generate a large number of demand points (patients) and a hierarchical set of healthcare facilities.\n",
    "2.  **Benchmark Traditional Search:** Time a standard nearest-neighbor search using `scipy` or `sklearn` as a baseline.\n",
    "3.  **Implement FAISS:** Build a `faiss` index for the facility locations.\n",
    "4.  **Benchmark FAISS Search:** Run the same search using the `faiss` index and compare the execution time.\n",
    "5.  **Hierarchical FAISS Search:** Show how to build separate indexes for each facility type (GP, CDC, Acute) to enable efficient, targeted queries based on the required level of care."

    "\n",
    "As demonstrated, `faiss` offers a massive performance improvement for nearest-neighbor searches, a foundational operation in spatial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Advantage:** Speed at scale. While the setup is slightly more complex than a one-line `BallTree` query, the speed-up is essential when dealing with hundreds of thousands or millions of points.\n",
    "* **Hierarchical Planning:** Building targeted indexes for different facility types is a clean and highly efficient way to model tiered service systems.\n",
    "* **Practical Applications:**\n",
    "    - **Large-Scale Allocation Models:** In optimization problems that require calculating a full distance matrix (demand points x facilities), `faiss` can pre-calculate the `k` nearest candidates for each demand point, dramatically reducing the problem size.\n",
    "    - **Interactive Dashboards:** For any web-based tool or dashboard where a user can click a point and expect an instant result for the nearest facility, `faiss` is the ideal backend engine.\n",
    "    - **Data Enrichment:** When joining large datasets based on proximity, `faiss` can quickly find the nearest feature from one dataset for every feature in another."
