    "## 08: Network-Based Accessibility Analysis with OSMnx\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To perform a more rigorous accessibility analysis by calculating travel times from many origins to the nearest of several destinations over a real-world street network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on concepts from notebooks 04 and 06. We will:\n",
    "1.  Use `osmnx` to download the street network for Exeter.\n",
    "2.  Define a set of destinations (e.g., supermarkets).\n",
    "3.  Define a set of origins (we'll use the centroids of LSOA polygons as proxies for residential areas).\n",
    "4.  Calculate the network travel time from each origin to its **single nearest** destination.\n",
    "5.  Create a choropleth map showing accessibility scores (travel times) across the city, highlighting areas with better or worse access to essential services."
