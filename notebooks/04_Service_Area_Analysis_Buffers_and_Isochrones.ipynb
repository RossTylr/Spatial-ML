    "**Goal:** To understand and compare two fundamental methods for defining service or catchment areas around points of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Geometric Buffers:** Simple circles drawn around a point representing a fixed straight-line (\"as the crow flies\") distance. Fast and easy, but often unrealistic in urban environments.\n",
    "2.  **Isochrones/Isodistances:** Service areas based on a real street network. They represent all the locations reachable within a specified travel time or distance. These are far more realistic for accessibility analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use libraries in Exeter as our points of interest and analyze their service areas."
