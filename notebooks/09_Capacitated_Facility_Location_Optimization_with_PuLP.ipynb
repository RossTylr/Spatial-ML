    "**Goal:** To move from heuristic site selection (like in notebook 01) to formal optimization. We will solve a classic operations research problem: the **Capacitated Facility Location Problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem answers the questions:\n",
    "* **Which** of our potential facilities should we open?\n",
    "* **How** should we assign demand from customers to these open facilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "All while respecting that each facility has a **maximum capacity** and that our goal is to **minimize total costs** (a combination of fixed opening costs and variable travel costs).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `PuLP` library, a popular and intuitive linear programming tool in Python."
