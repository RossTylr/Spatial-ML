    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To analyze how traffic congestion differentially impacts the accessibility of various healthcare facility types (GPs, Community Hospitals, Acute Hospitals) and to identify geographic clusters of this vulnerability using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "1.  **Establish a Facility Hierarchy:** Create a sample dataset of healthcare facilities in Exeter.\n",
    "2.  **Generate Time-Dependent Isochrones:** For each facility, calculate its service area for both peak and off-peak traffic conditions.\n",
    "3.  **Calculate a Traffic Sensitivity Index:** Quantify how much each facility's reach shrinks during peak hours.\n",
    "4.  **Visualize with KDE:** Create a heatmap to identify geographic 'hotspots' of high traffic sensitivity."

    "### 5. Analysis and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis reveals several key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variable Impact:** Traffic congestion does not affect all facilities equally. More centrally located facilities, or those reliant on arterial roads, tend to have higher sensitivity scores, meaning their effective service area shrinks dramatically during peak hours.\n",
    "* **KDE Hotspots:** The heatmap visually confirms where clusters of high-vulnerability facilities are located. These 'hotspots' indicate areas where the healthcare network as a whole is most fragile to disruptions from traffic. In our example, the area around the city center shows the highest density of sensitivity.\n",
    "* **Hierarchical Differences:** Acute hospitals, often located on major roads for regional access, can be paradoxically more sensitive to local congestion than suburban GP practices which may serve more localized road networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of analysis is crucial for robust healthcare planning, helping to identify where investment in transport infrastructure or the placement of new, smaller facilities could be most effective at mitigating the impact of traffic."
